Hello! The following prefixes can be used to call me:
- delta
- !delta

Slash commands are also supported!

Note that any TTS output is sent in the form of a video due to Discord not working with sound files!

Avaliable commands (use "help [command]" for information on each command):
- help - Shows this page!
- imagegen - Generate an image using machine learning, OpenAI DALL-E 3 and Stable Diffusion (SD) supported
- (slash command only) tts_from_text - Create a visualised TTS video from whatever you type in!
- (slash command only) tts_from_message - Create a visualised TTS video from a message link, as long as it's somewhere I can see it!
- (slash command only) transcribe_from_attachment - Attach a video or audio file and I'll be able to transcribe it!
- (slash command only) transcribe_from_message - Link a message and I'll transcribe the first attachment if it's an audio or video file!
- (slash command only) transcribe_from_url - Provide me with a link to a file and I'll transcribe the first attachment if it's an audio or video file! (You can use this if there's a Discord attachment in a server I can't see, just copy the link to it and I can handle the rest)

Special commands:
 - Mention/Message me - I can respond to requests and chat with you! All you need to do is message me or mention me!
   - Image attachment - I can see the images that you upload and you can ask me about them!
   - Text attachment - I can read raw text files, if you think Discord is too restricting or you want to send source code for me to look at, just attach the file and I will see it!
